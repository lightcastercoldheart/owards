emblem app for mobile + wearables


042815 - Emblem App

Remember that time when you got a gold star on your arm for doing good work? What if there was a way to celebrate your academic progress and feel awesome again with your mobile/wearable device!

The emblem app aggregates your data from your organization and visualize your progress and standing so you can keep track of where you are and what your accomplishments have been. The app also aims to act as a portal for important organizational updates and news / events.

We would like to gameify the experience of belonging to a group (school, clubs, teams) to form a healthy competitive bond between each member and to also foster a sense of constantly striving for betterment.
